அகர முதல எழுத்தெல்லாம் ஆதி
பகவன் முதற்றே உலகு.

I always wanted to check how I can write in tamil for my blog. I tried reading up on i18 and other methods but I couldn't find anything simple. Finally I settled on Google docs.

Google docs lets me write in Tamil (தமிழ்) and I can just copy paste it in my markdown file.
